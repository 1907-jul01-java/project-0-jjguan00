## Example: The Banking App
- [x] Build the application using Java 8.
- [x] All interaction with the user should be done through the console using the `Scanner` class.
- [x] Customers of the bank should be able to register with a username and password, and apply to open an account.
- [x] Customers should be able to apply for joint accounts.
- [x] Once the account is open, customers should be able to withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds between accounts.
- [] All basic validation should be done, such as trying to input negative amounts, overdrawing from accounts etc.
- [x] Employees of the bank should be able to view all of their customers information. This includes:
    - [x] Account information
    - [x] Account balances
    - []Personal information
- [x] Employees should be able to approve/deny open applications for accounts.
- [x] Bank admins should be able to view and edit all accounts. This includes:
    - [x] Approving/denying accounts
    - [] Withdrawing, depositing, transferring from all accounts
    - [] Canceling accounts
- [x] All information should be persisted using text files and serialization.
- [] 100% test coverage is expected using JUnit. You should be using TDD.
- [] Logging should be accomplished using Log4J. All transactions should be logged.
- [x] Create an SQL script that will create a user in an SQL database and a table schema for storing your bank users and account information.
- [] Your database should include at least 1 stored procedure.
- [x] Have your bank application connect to your SQL database using JDBC and store all information that way.
- [x] You should use the DAO design pattern for data connectivity.
